Getting started with Docker

1.  Install Docker (http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/ubuntulinux/)
2.  Grab the base ubuntulinux and run it to test Docker
sudo docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
# type exit to exit the image once you verify it worked
3.  Get the latest code from Git that contains a Dockerfile for our project.
4.  Create an image from the docker file
sudo docker build -t (your username)/ubuntu-node-hello .
5.  Verify the image exists:
sudo docker images
