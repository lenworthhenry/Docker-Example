ungit
======
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ungit.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/ungit)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FredrikNoren/ungit.png)](https://travis-ci.org/FredrikNoren/ungit)

The easiest way to use git. On any platform. Anywhere.

 * Clean and intuitive UI that makes it easy to _understand_ git.
 * Runs on any platform that node.js & git supports.
 * Web-based, meaning you can run it on your cloud/pure shell machine and use the ui from your browser (just browse to http://your-cloud-machine.com:8448).
 * Works well with GitHub.
 * [Gerrit](https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/) integration (view, checkout and push changes from/to gerrit).

Installing
----------
Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org) (≥ 0.10), [npm](https://npmjs.org/) (≥ 1.3.1, comes with node.js) and [git](http://git-scm.com/) (≥ 1.8.x). To install ungit just type:

	npm install -g ungit

Using
-----
Anywhere you want to start, just type:

	ungit

This will launch the server and open up a browser with the ui.

Configure
---------
Put a configuration file called .ungitrc in your home directory (`/home/USERNAME` on *nix, `C:/Users/USERNAME/` on windows). Can be in either json or ini format. See source/config.js for available options.

You can also override configuration variables at launch by specifying them as command line arguments; `ungit --port=8080`.

Example of `~/.ungitrc` configuration file to change default port and enable bugtracking:

```json
{
	"port": 8080,
	"bugtracking": true
}
```

Developing
----------

If you decide to install by cloning the repo, make sure to run `npm install` then  `grunt` after cloning (to fetch dependencies, build concatenated files and compile less). If you haven't already, you can install grunt by running `npm install -g grunt-cli`.

Once you've done that, you can start ungit by running `npm start`. Run the tests with `npm test`.
