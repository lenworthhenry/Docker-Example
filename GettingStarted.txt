First install npm and node:
sudo apt-get install node

Install Ruby:
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential

Install Ruby Gems:
sudo apt-get install rubygems

Install yo and the generators:

npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-webapp

npm install -g generator-angular

Install grunt-contrib system wide

sudo npm install grunt-contrib -g

Install compass:
sudo gem install compass


Log into the git server (192.241.170.37)
Add your ssh key to authorized_keys (or email me it encrypted
and I can add it for you manually)
Once in the server copy and paste the contents of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (from your local workstation) into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on 192.241.170.37

This will enable ssh access without logon

Once you have done that you can now copy the repository wiht this command:

git clone git@192.241.170.37:/opt/git/workspace.git

Once the command has finished as a sanity check run the server to make sure you are good to go:
cd to the directory that was created (workspace) and type "grunt server"

That should open a browser window with our application.

Git workflow
When you do commits (git commit -a 'Something Something Darkside!') you will actually be committing to your local repository.  If you want to commit that to all our repositories then commit to the server like this:
git push origin master
This will push all your changes in the current folder (and below the current folder) up to the server.

IF you wish to pull what someone else is working on, make sure they have committed it to the server.  Then you can pull the server folder with the pull command:

git pull origin master.
