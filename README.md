Docker-Example
==============

Example Repository that I used for demonstrating Node Js inside Docker

Main folder contains a yeoman based angular application.  

The server folder contains a node server application that implements passport js authentication using mongodb.

The basic folder contains a simple node application.

All 3 folders have Dockerfiles that demonostrate how to create a container for them.
